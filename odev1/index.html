    Borders and Colors: Each section should have a background color set to some color
    (of your choosing). Set the background color of each section title region to some unique
    color (of your choosing). Make sure that the background color still allows the user to
    view the text in the section and section title regions. Depending on the color you choose,
    you may want to change the color of the text so it can be easy to read.

    <div id="panel2" >
      <div class="title" style="background-color:yellow"><b style="color:gray">Köfte</b></div>
      </br></br>
      Spacing: Pay attention to the spacing shown in the mockup illustrations. Note the spacing
      between sections (both horizontal and vertical). Note the horizontal spacing between the edges
      of the section and the edges of the browser window. Also, note the spacing between
      the dummy text in each section and the edges of the section. Lastly, make sure the
      dummy text is "pushed down" enough so it doesn't overlap the section title region.

    <div id="panel3" >
      <div class="title" style="background-color:lightblue"><b>İskender</b></div>
      </br></br>
      In the desktop view (992px and above), each of the 3 sections should take up equal
      amount of space on the screen. As you make the browser window wider or narrower, each
      section should become wider or narrower. (Hint: use percentages to define width and use
      the 'float' property. See Lecture 24). For a visual reference of this view, see the desktop
      mockup illustration below. Set a black border
      on both the section and section
